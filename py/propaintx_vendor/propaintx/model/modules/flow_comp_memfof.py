    MemFOF (https://github.com/msu-video-group/memfof, ICCV'2025 Highlight) is a

    processing. Unlike RAFT, whose all-pairs correlation volume grows as
    O((H*W)^2), MemFOF uses a much smaller local correlation combined with 3-frame
    temporal context, at a fraction of RAFT's peak memory at 1080p.

    Given `frames` of shape (b, t, c, h, w) in [-1, 1] (ProPainter's convention,
    matching what RAFT_bi already expects), returns (gt_flows_forward,
    gt_flows_backward), each (b, t-1, 2, h, w), where:

    RAFT_bi with no changes anywhere else in the pipeline (including the RAFT
    chunking loop in inference_propainter.py, since the batching math below is
    designed to slot into arbitrary-length, possibly-overlapping input chunks
    without producing gaps or double-counted flow at chunk boundaries).

    Internally, MemFOF estimates flow using a 3-frame sliding window centered
    on each frame, giving (backward, forward) flow for that center frame in a
    single call. To get flow for every frame in `frames` -- including the
    first and last, which don't have both true neighbors -- the frame sequence
    is padded by duplicating the first/last frame. This only ever affects the
    two degenerate self-flow outputs that this wrapper already discards
    (see the derivation in the class docstring above / PR description), so it
    does not introduce any approximation into the flows that are actually used.
